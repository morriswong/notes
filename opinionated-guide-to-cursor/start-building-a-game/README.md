# Start building a game!

Before you all in on selling that micro-saas for 1 million ARR, if you have never build anything before, I would recommend you to start with a building a game. Why? Because that's fun and I wanted to remind you that building things can be fun, just look at Lego!

So here are some game ideas, feel free to pick an example to get started with "Who's guilty"

* The game would show 5 words at a time, you would have to pick the word that is closest to a theme
* For example: Vegetable, then you would have to pick the word that is actually a vegetable among the 5 words.
