# Start building a game!

Before you all in on selling that micro-saas for 1 million ARR, if you have never build anything before, I would recommend you to start with a building a game. Why? Because that's fun and I wanted to remind you that building things can be fun, just look at Lego!

So here are some game ideas, feel free to pick an example to get started with

* Pong
* Snake game
* Space Invaders
