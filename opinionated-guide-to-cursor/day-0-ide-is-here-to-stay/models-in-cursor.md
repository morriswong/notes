# Models in Cursor

I am sure in matter of weeks, there would be a new model release that "just kills all start up for x". Does model matter? While that is true, for me it just comes down to the price.

Why? Because the models are so good now for most things that it is more likely that it is the prompts that makes the bottle neck of what you are trying to do, that is to think clearly on what you really want.

My benchmark at late 2025 would be Claude Haiku 4.5, which is a good all purpose model at a reasonable(ish) price, here is the [price table](https://cursor.com/docs/models) for the model:

| Model            | Input | Cache Write | Cache Read | Output |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $1.00 | $1.25       | $0.10      | $5.00  |

Using this as the reference point, I would say models beyond this is "expensive" models and model below this is the "cheap" models. You should default to start with cheaper models, and when not satisfied with the response, switch to a more expensive model.
