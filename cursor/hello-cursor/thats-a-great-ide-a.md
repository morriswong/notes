# That's a great "IDE"a

Cursor is at a cross road: Non-developers find it too difficult to use and developers find the next whatever agent is "better" and ditch cursor in a second.&#x20;

But I think Cursor is really at the sweet spot of a bit of everything that people needed.

**Non-developers**

* Cursor is great, but also not so great for non developers, too many buttons
* People are familiar with Claude artifacts types of experience, how can Cursor be different?
* The vibe coding is fun until you wanted to actually use it, just like the AI slop on social media, AI slop also happens to code
* They needed to move to professional tools, which Cursor happened to be one of them.

**Developers**

* There are two types of developers, the one with freedom and the one that doesn't have freedom
* It is the developers that have freedom would speak ill of Cursor, because there is always something better out there
* However, the enterprise customer is happy with Cursor, stable $100 bill per person, easy to calculate the cost

Now that we have this premise in mind, here are some of the popular tools out there now:

* Terminal Agents: Claude Code/ Codex
* IDE variants: Cursor/Windsurf/Github Copilot&#x20;
* Web based: Loveable/Bolt.new/Replit

I used all of them, but IDE is the middle ground that most people can agree on, so that's why I would stick to an IDE.
