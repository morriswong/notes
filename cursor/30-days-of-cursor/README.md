# Why Cursor?

<figure><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/abpbmq.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Cursor is at a cross road: Non-developers find it too difficult to use and developers find the next whatever agent is "better" and ditch cursor in a second.

But I think Cursor is really at the sweet spot of a bit of everything that people needed.

**Non-developers**

* Cursor is great, but also not so great for non developers, too many buttons
* People are familiar with Claude artifacts types of experience, how can Cursor be different?
* The vibe coding is fun until you wanted to actually use it, just like the AI slop on social media, AI slop also happens to code
* They needed to move to professional tools, which Cursor happened to be one of them.

**Developers**

* There are two types of developers, the one with freedom and the one that doesn't have freedom
* It is the developers that have freedom would speak ill of Cursor, because there is always something better out there
* However, the enterprise customer is happy with Cursor, stable $100 bill per person, easy to calculate the cost

Now that we have this premise in mind, here are some of the popular tools out there now:

* Terminal Agents: Claude Code/ Codex
* IDE variants: Cursor/Windsurf/Github Copilot
* Web based: Loveable/Bolt.new/Replit
* General consumer apps: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

I used all of them, but I find myself keep coming back to using Cursor for coding, I think think of these 10 reason why that is the case and why I am bullish in general for cursor.

1. **Early mover advantage:** Now most MCP would have a Cursor upfront, free marketing!
2. **IDE form factor sticks:** Terminal is great, but most people use IDE
3. **A "Swiss" spot for models:** Guess what, they now make their own models as well
4. **The developer niche:** Developer is hard to please, they are still figuring out
5. **Agent mode to expand beyond developers:** Crossing the chasim to more mainstream user
6. **Plugin and extensions just works:** Just reuse the existing extensions ecosystem of VS Code
7. **Less vendor lock in:** All the .cursorrules are just markdown files in the filesystem
8. **Negotiate a cheaper inference price for us:** It can be the groupon for model inference
9. **Professional use from big companies:** The fact that professional people uses it says it all
10. **OpenAI/Nivida got their back:** As part of the circular bubble, they would get saved (?)

But that's also true for Windsurf/Github Copilot/ Zed/ Kiro? That's true, and that's why I think the IDE is the right form factor for coding agents, just like how we use IDE.
