# Hello Cursor

I find myself keep coming back to using Cursor for coding, I think think of these 10 reason why that is the case and why I am bullish in general for cursor.

***

1. **Early mover advantage:** Now most MCP would have a Cursor upfront, free marketing!
2. **IDE form factor sticks:** Terminal is great, but most people use IDE
3. **A "Swiss" spot for models:** Guess what, they now make their own models as well
4. **The developer niche:** Developer is hard to please, they are still figuring out
5. **Agent mode to expand beyond developers:** Crossing the chasim to more mainstream user
6. **Plugin and extensions just works:** Just reuse the existing extensions ecosystem of VS Code
7. **Less vendor lock in:** All the .cursorrules are just markdown files in the filesystem
8. **Negotiate a cheaper inference price for us:** It can be the groupon for model inference
9. **Professional use from big companies:** The fact that professional people uses it says it all
10. **OpenAI/Nivida got their back:** As part of the circular bubble, they would get saved (?)
