# 10 reason why I am bullish on Cursor

I find myself keep coming back to using Cursor for coding, I think think of these 10 reason why that is the case and why I am bullish in general for cursor.

Early mover advantage

* Now most MCP would have a Cursor upfront, free marketing!

IDE form factor sticks

* Terminal is great, but most people use IDE

A "Swiss" spot for models

* Guess what, they now make their own models as well

The developer audience niche

* Developer is hard to please, they are still figuring out

Agent mode to expand beyond developers

* This is the point that it will gradually cross the chasim to more mainstream user

Plugin and extensions just works

* Like Microsoft Edge, you can reuse the existing extensions ecosystem

Less vendor lock in

* All the rules are in the form of a markdown file that you can find it back in the filesystem

Negotiate a cheaper inference price for us

* It can be the groupon for model inference, and we are very clear that this can help us

Professional use from big companies

* Start with the pros, then with the mass

OpenAI/Nivida got their back

* They are part of the circular bubble, so more likely that the bigger company would save Cursor
